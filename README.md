# zerofuckgiven
Show how much you care. Also unleash your anger to the terminal, don't be afraid, it will listen.

Installation:

To compile it you have to get a C compliler like gcc. On a Debian based system type

"sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get install build-essential"

After you retrieved the gcc, use it to compile the three .c files:

"gcc fuck.c -o fuck" and "gcc fucksgiven.c -o fucksgiven" and "gcc forgiveme.c -o forgiveme"

Now put those three new files where your $PATH points to, on Debian you can create /home/{username}/bin and put them inside that directory.
At last you have to log in (and first log out:) to have Bash look again in the directories pointed at by $PATH.


Usage:

Type "fucksgiven" and it will tell you how many fucks you gave since last restart or since you last asked for forgiveness.

If you're angry, rather type "fuck" or even "fuck fuckfuck fuck fuck *other swearing* fuck" then damaging your hardware or people around you. [fuck] will happily listen to your swearing and store up all those fucks uttered. After you cooled down a bit, type "fucksgiven" to see how intense your anger was. On an amd64 system [fuck] should be able to take more then 18'000'000'000'000'000'000 single {fuck} uttered.

In case you don't like to have all those fucks stored, type "forgiveme". It will clear out all the f-words you uttered and it does it even without any explanation so you don't have to come up with a reason you want to have those f-words removed. Real forgiveness doesn't take an argument.
